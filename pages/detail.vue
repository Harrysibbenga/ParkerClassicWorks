          In case you arenâ€™t familiar, car detailing involves undertaking a
          deep, or detailed, clean of a car, accompanied with restoration of
          damaged panels or poor paintwork. This can be as simple as a light
          polish or as in-depth as wet sand surface removal but will vary from
          owner to owner.
